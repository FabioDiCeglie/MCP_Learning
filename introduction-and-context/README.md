# MCP Crash Course for Python Developers

## Part 1: Introduction & Context

### What is MCP and Why Does it Matter?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging as a significant standard in the AI landscape. At its core, MCP defines a standardized way for Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with external tools and services.

While the concept of giving LLMs access to tools via function calling isn't new for AI developers, MCP introduces a crucial element: **standardization**. This protocol provides a common language for interactions between models and the tools they leverage.

While many demonstrations focus on integrating MCP with personal AI assistants (like Claude Desktop or Cursor), this guide takes a different approach. We'll dive into how you, as a Python developer, can build custom MCP servers and integrate them effectively into your production applications and sophisticated agent systems. This crash course focuses on bridging the gap between the hype and the practical implementation details needed for backend development.
